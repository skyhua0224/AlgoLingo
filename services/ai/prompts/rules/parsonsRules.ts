export const PARSONS_RULES = `
- **PARSONS PUZZLE CONSTRAINTS**:
    - You MUST generate at least **5 lines** of code for the 'lines' array.
    - Do NOT split simple print statements just to increase line count.
    - Choose algorithms or logic flows that naturally require 5+ lines (e.g., if/else blocks, loops, variable initialization + processing).
    - If the logic is too simple, add context, comments, or variable setup to separate lines to meet the length requirement.
    - Ensure logical indentation is implicitly clear in the code content if 'indentation' is false, or ready for sorting if 'indentation' is true.
